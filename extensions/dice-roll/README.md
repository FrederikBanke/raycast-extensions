# Roll Dice

Roll any number of n-sided dice.

The format of the input is `ndm`, where `n` is a number that represents the amount of dice to roll, `d` is the literal letter *d*, and `m` is the number of sides on the dice to roll.

`nd` can be omitted, if you want to roll a straight number, so the input is just `m`.

Combine rolls with `+`, like `1d20 + 2d6 + 5`.

You can re-roll an input by selecting it in the results list, and pressing `enter`.
